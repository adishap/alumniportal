It's easy, Right..?? I think if we follow the steps we will create web app that hopefully does all things pretty well. I'm not telling you this is the great document ever made, but rather, we are going to use this  as a walk-through journey of creating process and hopefully do as many smart things as we can along the way.
<br> 
Let's get started...

<p>
<h3>
 Step 1<small>Plan the website</small>
</h3>
A common problem with many Web projects: failure to plan.Planning is essential.<br>
Decide the aim, purpose and goal of the website.Collect all the requirements(reason to make that website) and from the requirments choose the idea which suits best.
<br>
<strong>Sketch your Idea</strong>
<br>
Get your brain around what kinds of tools and processes will accomplish your goals.Create a roadmap document that provides a broad overview of the process of developing a website, from the initial needs assessment through the launch, maintenance and follow-up.This is where we put all the ideas, literally everything into a giant to-do list.
</p>

<p>
<h3>
 Step 2<small> Decide development Approach</small>
</h3>
When done with the planning,we are going to analyze the system we are going to build.It requires these things to be completed:
<ol>
<li>Decide techstack we are going to use.</li>
<li>Developing a Workflow.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Deciding the techstack</strong>
<br>
Decide the technology which you are going to work upon.I used :
<ul>
	<li>HTML</li>
	<li>CSS</li>
	<li>JavaScript</li>
	<li>Bootstrap</li>
	<li>PHP</li>
	<li>MySQL</li>
</ul>
For front-end, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap(it is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework) is used. There are number of frameworks available but I like bootstrap as it is completely free to download and use!
<br>
 For back-end, I made the choice to go with a combination of MySQL and PHP to handle all our behind-the-scenes data handling and storage.MySQL is a popular choice of database for use in web applications.
 <br>
 <br>
<strong>Developing a Workflow</strong>
<br>
As my websites have users, that means it needs a sign up form and a log in area for returning users.Because users should be just as concerned about security as I am, users need to be able to change their passwords, change their login, and delete their accounts. As I need to manage more than 10 webpages, so there is need to think about some workflow.

A Workflow Diagram is a simple form of Flowchart depicting the flow of tasks or actions from one person or group to another. It typically consists of a set of symbols representing actions or individuals connected by arrows indicating the flow from one to another. 
<br>

<br>
Itâ€™s not pretty, but you can create better with many tools like SmartDraw, Giffy,etc.
<strong>Web root organisation</strong>
<br>
This is what we have for files at the root of our web directory so far.
<br>
I used scaffolding technique idea to maintain website. It is a technique supported by some model-view-controller frameworks.
<br>
<br>
<strong>HTML & CSS</strong>
<br>
Make an skelton pages 
</p>


<p>
<h3>
 Step 3<small>Look and feel of the website </small>
</h3>
<strong>Planning the look of website.</strong>
<br>
One thing I do is that design the look and feel of the website with a wired-frame tool. My personnel favourate is <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">balsamiq mockups</a>.
We should create mock ups as it acts as a bridge between raw creative thoughts and the final product we are going to develop.
<br>
<strong>Developing the front-end of website</strong>
<br>
Now, it's time to get our hands dirty with some markup! 
</p>

<h4>And Finally...The Website!!!</h4>
